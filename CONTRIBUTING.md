# Contributing

Thanks for helping with the MIRA FIVE SDK for Symfony.

## Before you start

Small fixes (a bug, a typo, a missing test) can go straight to a pull request. For
anything that changes behavior or the public API, open an issue first so we can agree on
the approach before you write it. The public API of every SDK is defined in
[mirafive/protocol](https://github.com/mirafive/protocol) (API.md, PROTOCOL.md, FLAGS.md),
so an API change starts there.

## Setup

```sh
composer install
composer check
```

`check` runs Pint, PHPStan and the test suite. CI runs the same on every supported PHP
version.

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`.
- The scope is optional and names the area, e.g. `flags`, `pageviews`, `cdn`.
- The description is lowercase, has no trailing period and says what changed:
  `fix: count property bytes as UTF-8, as the server now does`.
- A breaking change gets a `!`: `feat(flags)!: drop the v0 bootstrap format`.
- One logical change per commit.

## Pull requests

- PRs are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the commit on `main` and must follow
  the commit format above. CI checks it.
- Keep a PR to one change. Say what changed and why; link the issue.
- Don't edit `CHANGELOG.md` or the version. The maintainer writes both when releasing.
